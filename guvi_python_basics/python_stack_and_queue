Stack
A Stack is a data structure that follows the LIFO(Last In First Out) principle. 
To implement a stack, we need two simple operations:

push - It adds an element to the top of the stack.
pop - It removes an element from the top of the stack.

Operations:

Adding - It adds the items in the stack and increases the stack size. The addition takes place at the top of the stack.
Deletion - It consists of two conditions, first, if no element is present in the stack, then underflow occurs in the stack, and second, if a stack contains some elements, then the topmost element gets removed. It reduces the stack size.
Traversing - It involves visiting each element of the stack.


Characteristics:

Insertion order of the stack is preserved.
Useful for parsing the operations.
Duplicacy is allowed.

code:
x = ["Python", "C", "Android"]   
x.push("Java")   
x.push("C++")   
print(x)   
print(x.pop())   
print(x)   
print(x.pop())   
print(x)   


Queue
A Queue follows the First-in-First-Out (FIFO) principle. 
It is opened from both the ends hence we can easily add elements to the back and can remove elements from the front.

To implement a queue, we need two simple operations:

enqueue - It adds an element to the end of the queue.
dequeue - It removes the element from the beginning of the queue.

Operations on Queue

Addition - It adds the element in a queue and takes place at the rear end, i.e., at the back of the queue.
Deletion - It consists of two conditions - If no element is present in the queue, Underflow occurs in the queue, or if a stack contains some elements then element present at the front gets deleted.
Traversing - It involves to visit each element of the queue.



Characteristics

Insertion order of the queue is preserved.
Duplicacy is allowed.
Useful for parsing CPU task operations.

import queue   
# Queue is created as an object 'L'  
L = queue.Queue(maxsize=10)   
  
# Data is inserted in 'L' at the end using put()   
L.put(9)   
L.put(6)   
L.put(7)   
L.put(4)   
# get() takes data from   
# from the head    
# of the Queue   
print(L.get())   
print(L.get())   
print(L.get())   
print(L.get())
