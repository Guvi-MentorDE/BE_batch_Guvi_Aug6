Window Functions In SQL
● Window functions: These are special SQL functions that perform a calculation across a set of related rows.
● How it works: Instead of operating on individual rows, a window function operates on a group or 'window' of rows that are
somehow related to the current row. This allows for complex calculations based on these related rows.
● Window definition: The 'window' in window functions refers to a set of rows. The window can be defined using different
criteria depending on the requirements of your operation.
● Partitions: By using the PARTITION BY clause, you can divide your data into smaller sets or 'partitions'. The window
function will then be applied individually to each partition.
● Order of rows: You can specify the order of rows in each partition using the ORDER BY clause. This order influences how
some window functions calculate their result.
● Frames: The ROWS/RANGE clause lets you further narrow down the window by defining a 'frame' or subset of rows within
each partition.
● Comparison with Aggregate Functions: Unlike aggregate functions that return a single result per group, window
functions return a single result for each row of the table based on the group of rows defined in the window.
● Advantage: Window functions allow for more complex operations that need to take into account not just the current row,
but also its 'neighbours' in some way.
