Dash
====
Dash is a python framework created by plotly for creating interactive web applications
Dash is written on the top of Flask, Plotly.js and React.js.
With Dash, you donâ€™t have to learn HTML, CSS and Javascript in order to create interactive dashboards, you only need python
Dash is open source and the application build using this framework are viewed on the web browser.


Dash applications are made up of 2 building blocks :
1) Layout
2) Callbacks

Layout describes the look and feel of the app, it defines the elements such as graphs, dropdowns etc and the placement, size, color etc of these elements.
Dash contains Dash HTML components using which we can create and style HTML content such as headings, paragraph, images etc using python.


Callbacks are used to bring interactivity to the dash applications. These are the functions using which, for example, we can define the activity that would happen on clicking a button or a dropdown.
