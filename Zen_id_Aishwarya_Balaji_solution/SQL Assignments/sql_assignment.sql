--------Q1) find the country which has 3 most highest no of orders ?  //solve:

-------result : country , orders 

-------Solution 1:
SELECT country, COUNT(*) AS orders 
FROM orders 
GROUP BY country 
HAVING COUNT(*)>0 
LIMIT 3;

-------Solution 2:
SELECT country, COUNT(order_id) AS orders 
FROM orders 
GROUP BY country 
HAVING COUNT(order_id)>0 
LIMIT 3;

-------Solution 3:
SELECT country, COUNT(order_id) AS orders 
FROM orders 
GROUP BY country 
ORDER BY COUNT(order_id) desc 
LIMIT 3;

-------Solution 4:
SELECT tmp.country, MAX(orders) AS orders FROM (
    SELECT country, row_number() OVER(PARTITION BY country ORDER BY COUNT(order_id) desc) AS orders 
    FROM orders
) tmp 
GROUP BY tmp.country 
ORDER BY MAX(orders) desc
LIMIT 3;

-------Solution 5:
SELECT tmp.country, MAX(orders) AS orders FROM (
    SELECT country, COUNT(state) OVER(PARTITION BY country ORDER BY order_amt desc) AS orders 
    FROM orders
) tmp 
GROUP BY tmp.country 
ORDER BY MAX(orders) desc
LIMIT 3;

----------Q2) sum of order amounts for each country. 

----------result ; country , sum of order amounts. 

-------Solution 1:
SELECT country, SUM(order_amt) AS sum_of_order_amounts 
FROM orders 
GROUP BY country;


----------Q3) provide ranking for the countries based on the total amount of order. 
----------result : rank, country, total amount  of orders. 

-------Solution 1: Based on orders amount
SELECT RANK() OVER(ORDER BY temp.total_amt_on_orders DESC) as 'rank', temp.country, MAX(temp.total_amt_on_orders) AS total_orders 
FROM (
    SELECT country, SUM(order_amt) OVER(PARTITION BY country) AS total_amt_on_orders 
    FROM orders
    ) temp 
GROUP BY country, total_amt_on_orders;

-------Solution 2: Based on orders count
SELECT RANK() OVER(ORDER BY temp.total_orders DESC) as 'rank', temp.country, MAX(temp.total_orders) AS total_orders 
FROM (
    SELECT country, COUNT(order_id) OVER(PARTITION BY country) AS total_orders 
    FROM orders
    ) temp 
GROUP BY country, total_orders;


----------Q4) join sales vs orders. 
----------find the orders that are still pedning to be delivered 

----------result : only cust_id , pending status 

-------Solution 1:
SELECT orders.cust_id, MIN(delivery_status) AS delivery_status 
FROM orders 
JOIN sales ON sales.cust_id = orders.cust_id 
GROUP BY orders.cust_id 
HAVING MIN(delivery_status) = 'pending';


----------Q5) compare sales from todays date with previous date. 

----------all the sales happened on '2023-05-01' vs '2023-04-31'

----------result : current row , previous date , diff. 

-------Solution 1:
SELECT temp1.sale_date AS current_row, 
LAG(temp1.sale_date, 1, 0) OVER(ORDER BY temp1.total_amt) AS previous_date, 
temp1.total_amt - LAG(temp1.total_amt, 1, 0) OVER(ORDER BY temp1.sale_date) AS sales_diff 
FROM (
    SELECT temp.sale_date, SUM(temp.order_amt) AS total_amt 
    FROM (
        SELECT orders.cust_id, order_id, country, state, MIN(order_amt) AS order_amt, 
        MIN(sale_date) AS sale_date, MIN(delivery_status) AS curr_delivery_status 
        FROM orders 
        JOIN sales on sales.cust_id = orders.cust_id 
        GROUP BY order_id, orders.cust_id, country, state
        ) temp 
    GROUP BY sale_date
    ) temp1;
