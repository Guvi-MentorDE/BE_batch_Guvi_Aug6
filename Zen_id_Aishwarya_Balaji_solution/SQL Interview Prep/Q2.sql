-- Table: Employee

-- +---------------+---------+
-- | Column Name   | Type    |
-- +---------------+---------+
-- | employee_id   | int     |
-- | team_id       | int     |
-- +---------------+---------+
-- employee_id is the primary key for this table.
-- Each row of this table contains the ID of each employee and their respective team.
-- Write an SQL query to find the team size of each of the employees.

-- Return result table in any order.

-- The query result format is in the following example:

-- Employee Table:
-- +-------------+------------+
-- | employee_id | team_id    |
-- +-------------+------------+
-- |     1       |     8      |
-- |     2       |     8      |
-- |     3       |     8      |
-- |     4       |     7      |
-- |     5       |     9      |
-- |     6       |     9      |
-- +-------------+------------+
-- Result table:
-- +-------------+------------+
-- | employee_id | team_size  |
-- +-------------+------------+
-- |     1       |     3      |
-- |     2       |     3      |
-- |     3       |     3      |
-- |     4       |     1      |
-- |     5       |     2      |
-- |     6       |     2      |
-- +-------------+------------+
-- Employees with Id 1,2,3 are part of a team with team_id = 8.
-- Employees with Id 4 is part of a team with team_id = 7.
-- Employees with Id 5,6 are part of a team with team_id = 9.

-- solution:

CREATE TABLE employee(employee_id INT, team_id INT, constraint pk Primary Key (employee_id));

INSERT INTO employee VALUES(1, 8);
INSERT INTO employee VALUES(2, 8);
INSERT INTO employee VALUES(3, 8);
INSERT INTO employee VALUES(4, 7);
INSERT INTO employee VALUES(5, 9);
INSERT INTO employee VALUES(6, 9);

SELECT employee_id, 
    COUNT(team_id) OVER(PARTITION BY team_id) AS team_size 
FROM employee 
ORDER BY employee_id;
