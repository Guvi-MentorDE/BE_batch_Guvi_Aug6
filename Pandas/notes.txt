Introduction:
1) Pandas is a widely-used Python library built on top of NumPy
2) Pandas stands for ‘panel data’. Note that pandas is typically stylized as an all-lowercase word.
3) Pandas was designed to work with two-dimensional data (similar to Excel spreadsheets)

Types:
1) Series:
    Series are a special type of data structure available in the pandas Python library. 
    Pandas Series are similar to NumPy arrays, except that we can give them a named or datetime index instead of just a numerical index.
Main Advantage of Pandas Series:
NumPy array elements must be all string, or all integers, or all booleans - you get the point
pandas Series is flexible

2) Dataframe:
    A pandas DataFrame is a two-dimensional data structure that has labels for both its rows and columns.
